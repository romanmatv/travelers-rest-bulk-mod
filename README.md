## FasterFueling

Need to put 100 fuel into a Crafter but don't want to click multiple times now just hold right click while left clicking and 5x the fuel will be pulled from inventory to Crafter.

## LargeBatchCooking

Needing to bake more bread but don't want to babysit the crafter to refill as much? Can now do larger batches (defaults to x5 recipe holding right click when entering the crafter will change the recipes)

## QuickWaterWell

Just brewed 100 stouts? well time to press refill water buckets 100 times, but now it is just Once! (while holding right click)

## SkipFishingMod

Can't handle the fishing mini game like me? well here is DrStalkers no fishing mod shamelessly borrowed from here https://github.com/DrStalker/TravellersRest-EasyFishing.
