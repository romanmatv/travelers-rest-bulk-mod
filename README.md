## FasterFueling

Need to put 100 fuel into a Crafter but don't want to click multiple times now just hold right click while left clicking and 5x the fuel will be pulled from inventory to Crafter.

Just brewed 100 stouts? well time to press refill water buckets 100 times, but now it is just Once! (while holding right click)
